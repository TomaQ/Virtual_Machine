How to Compile:

	In a Unix console, navigate to the folder containing the source code.
Afterwards, type the following command to compile the program:
	- make compiler


Commands:

	After executing the command above, a file is created that contains code to
execute is placed in the same folder.
	Type any of the following commands in a Unix console to run their respected
functions:

	- "./compiler": This command will run the entire program, but display nothing to the screen

	- "./compiler -v": This command will display the Virtual Machine execution trace from the Virtual Machine

	- "./compiler -l": This command will display the lexemelist from the Scanner

	- "./compiler -a": This command will display the generated assembly code from the Parser/Code Generator

	- make clean: This command will delete any output files generated by the program. After executing this command, you must execute "make compiler" again.

	Note: All commands create a file called compiler_output.txt


Example:

	This is an example of what your console might look like after commands have
been entered:

	eric@ubuntu:~/Dropbox/Fall/Systems Software/Virtual_Machine$ make clean
	rm main.o
	rm compiler
	eric@ubuntu:~/Dropbox/Fall/Systems Software/Virtual_Machine$ make compiler
	gcc -c main.c
	gcc -o compiler main.o
	eric@ubuntu:~/Dropbox/Fall/Systems Software/Virtual_Machine$ ./compiler
